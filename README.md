# ðŸ§­ Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and Bidirectional Dijkstra â€“ Performance Analysis

This project provides a comparative analysis of the classic Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bidirectional Dijkstra's algorithm using randomly generated graphs. Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, it demonstrates the performance difference between the two algorithms across increasing graph sizes.

# ðŸš€ Project Overview

The notebook creates directed weighted graphs and applies both Dijkstraâ€™s and Bidirectional Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms to find shortest paths. It records and plots their execution times as the number of nodes scales up.

# ðŸ§± Code Structure and Function Descriptions

**class PriorityQueue**

A custom priority queue based on heapq for efficient shortest-path computation.

*_init_(self, verbose=False)*: Initializes the heap and counter. If verbose=True, prints popped items.

*add(priority, item)*: Adds or updates an item with the given priority.

*update(priority, item)*: Updates the priority of an existing item.

*pop()*: Pops the item with the lowest priority, skipping removed ones.



---

**class Edge**

Represents an edge with a target vertex and a distance.


---

**class Graph**

Stores a directed graph via an adjacency list.

*add_edge(vertex1, vertex2, distance)*: Adds a directed edge from vertex1 to vertex2.



---

**Dijkstra(graph, start)**

Classic Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue.

Returns two dictionaries:

distances: shortest distances from start to all nodes.

previous: previous node on the shortest path to each vertex.




---

**reconstruct_path(previous, start, target)**

Reconstructs the shortest path from start to target using the previous map returned by Dijkstra.


---

**bidirectional_dijkstra(graph, start, target)**

Performs Bidirectional Dijkstraâ€™s by simultaneously searching from both the start and target nodes.

Returns the length of the shortest path between start and target.



---

**create_graph(num_vertices, num_edges)**

Creates a random directed graph with the given number of vertices and edges. Edge weights are random integers between 1 and 10.


---

**measure_execution_time(n)**

For each n (number of vertices), creates a graph and measures:

Time for classic Dijkstra's algorithm (from node 0).

Time for bidirectional Dijkstra's algorithm (from node 0 to n-1).


Returns two lists with execution times for each algorithm.


---

Visualization

Uses matplotlib to plot the execution times of both algorithms against the number of vertices.

# ðŸ“Š Sample Output

A graph comparing execution times of both algorithms on random graphs of increasing size. Bidirectional Dijkstra often performs faster due to its simultaneous search.
